    "> Amazon OpenSearch Service (successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service) is a managed service that\n",
    "makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. Amazon OpenSearch\n",
    "Service supports OpenSearch and legacy Elasticsearch OSS. When you create a cluster, you have the\n",
    "option of which search engine to use. OpenSearch Service offers broad compatibility with Elasticsearch\n",
    "OSS 7.10, the final open source version of the software.OpenSearch is a fully open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analysis. OpenSearch Service provisions all the resources for your cluster and launches it. It also automatically detects and replaces failed OpenSearch Service nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures. You can scale your cluster with a single API call or a few clicks in the console."
