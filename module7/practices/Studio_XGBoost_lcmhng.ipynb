The downloaded and preprocessed dataset is in the `data` folder that accompanies this notebook. It's been split into training and validation datasets. To see how the dataset was preprocessed, see this [XGBoost customer churn notebook that starts with the original dataset](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb).  \n",

    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "Now, we can specify our XGBoost hyperparameters, including the following key hyperparameters:\n",
    "- `max_depth` Controls how deep each tree within the algorithm can be built.  Deeper trees can lead to better fit, but are more computationally expensive and can lead to overfitting.  Typically, you need to explore trade-offs in model performance between using a large number of shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",
    "- `subsample` Controls training data sampling.  This hyperparameter can help reduce overfitting, but setting it too low can also starve the model of data.\n",
    "- `num_round` Controls the number of boosting rounds.  This is essentially the number of subsequent models that are trained using the residuals of previous iterations.  More rounds can produce a better fit on the training data, but can be computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `eta` Controls how aggressive each round of boosting is.  Larger values lead to more conservative boosting.\n",
    "- `gamma` Controls how aggressively trees are grown.  Larger values lead to more conservative models.\n",
    "- `min_child_weight` Also controls how aggresively trees are grown. Large values lead to a more conservative algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see [XGBoost's hyperparameters GitHub page](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/doc/parameter.md)."
